# Full System Design

This directory contains the complete architectural foundation for Loom's phase-driven, infinite animation system.
These documents are organized by topic and provide the verbatim source of truth for building implementation plans.

## How to Use These Documents

1. **For implementation planning**: Start with `00-core-invariants.md` to understand non-negotiables, then read the relevant topic document.

2. **For building a phase**: Consult `13-engineering-phases.md` for sequencing, then deep-dive into the topic documents that phase covers.

3. **For block implementation**: Use `10-canonical-primitives.md` for exact specifications and `11-starter-composites.md` for how primitives compose.

4. **For UI work**: Read `08-ui-detail.md` for structure and `09-ux-philosophy.md` for the guiding principles.

## The Core Insight

> **You are building a deterministic, infinite visual instrument.**

Everything in these documents serves that single truth.
