      <p>
        The Loom Editor is a node-based environment for designing procedural SVG animations. Instead of placing keyframes on
        a linear timeline, you build a <strong>graph of blocks</strong> that describe what exists, how it varies per element,
        and how it changes over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animations are expressed as <strong>programs</strong> – pure functions of time that produce a declarative render tree.
        Fields, signals, and phase machines let you work at the level of <em>rules</em> and <em>structure</em>, rather than
        per-frame edits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The editor is split into a few key areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>Library</strong> (left) holds blocks: Sources, Fields, Time, Compose, Render, FX, and Macros.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>Patch</strong> (center) is where those blocks are wired into lanes that represent different value domains.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>Preview</strong> and <strong>Control Surface</strong> (right) let you see and play with the running program.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Under the hood, the patch is compiled to a strongly-typed kernel (V4) that knows about Scenes, per-element Fields,
        phase machines, compositors, and render trees.
      </p>

function ConceptsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="help-center-page">
      <h2>Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        The Loom Editor is built around a few core ideas that show up throughout the app and codebase. Understanding these
        makes it much easier to reason about patches.
      </p>
      <h3>Scenes and Targets</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>Scene</strong> is the static geometry you want to animate. Today that&apos;s primarily SVG paths (logo shapes,
        text outlines, abstract lines).
      </p>
      <p>
        From a Scene, you sample <strong>Targets</strong> – points along the paths. Each target becomes an independent element
        (a particle, a stroke segment, a glyph) that can be animated separately.
      </p>
      <h3>Fields</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>Field</strong> is a value that varies per element. Instead of saying “all particles start at x = 200”, you
        say “each particle has its own start position inside this region, or at some radial distance, with jitter”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the kernel, a Field is a function:
      </p>
      <pre className="help-center-code">
        <code>Field&lt;T&gt; = (seed, n, ctx) =&gt; readonly T[];</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Fields are evaluated in bulk at compile time, producing arrays of per-element values: positions, delays, durations,
        sizes, opacities, colors, and more.
      </p>
      <h3>Signals</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>Signal</strong> is a value that changes over time. While Fields give you variation across elements, Signals
        give you variation across time: global progress, oscillators, phase machines, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signals feed into blocks that derive motion, easing, and other time-based behavior.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase Machines</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>Phase Machine</strong> structures an animation into phases such as entrance, hold, and exit. It produces a
        <code>PhaseSample</code> with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the current phase name,</li>
        <li>a normalized progress <code>u</code> within that phase,</li>
        <li>raw time <code>tLocal</code> since the phase started.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This lets you write animation logic that thinks in terms of “where in the entrance are we?” rather than “what is the
        absolute time in milliseconds?”.
      </p>
      <h3>Programs and Render Trees</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>Program</strong> is the compiled result of your patch: a function of time and runtime context that returns
        a <strong>RenderTree</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RenderTree is a nested structure of groups, shapes, and effects that maps neatly onto SVG. Programs may also expose
        <strong>timeline hints</strong> so the player can present finite shots and ambient loops in a friendly way.
      </p>
    </div>
  );

function MotivationPage() {
  return (
    <div className="help-center-page">
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional animation tools revolve around a timeline and keyframes. That works well for short, bespoke sequences, but
        it breaks down when you want:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>many elements (hundreds or thousands) moving together,</li>
        <li>controlled randomness and variation,</li>
        <li>animations that can run indefinitely without obvious loops.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Loom Editor is designed for these &quot;procedural&quot; scenarios. Instead of micro-managing every element, you
        declare rules and structures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how to sample geometry into targets,</li>
        <li>how to assign per-element timing and style,</li>
        <li>how to structure time (phases, beats, cycles),</li>
        <li>how to map those ingredients into motion and drawing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This makes it much easier to create rich logo reveals, particle effects, and ambient surfaces that can be reused,
        parameterized, and exported.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

function InspirationPage() {
  return (
    <div className="help-center-page">
      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        The design borrows from several traditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Modular synthesizers</strong> and visual patch bays, where cables represent data flow and small modules combine to
          form complex behaviors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shader/node editors</strong> in tools like TouchDesigner, Unreal, or Blender, where graphs describe material pipelines
          and post-processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Generative art</strong> systems that emphasize randomness, structure, and emergent behavior over fixed timelines.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is to bring that spirit to SVG/logo animation, with a focus on readability, type safety, and exportability to
        the web.

      <h2>Roadmap</h2>

        The editor is under active development. Some directions the system is moving toward:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Richer ambient loops:</strong> better primitives and presets for multi-scale looping, so animations can run for a
          long time while still “rhyming”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>More compositors:</strong> global post-effects that can be layered onto any program without changing the core logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Export paths:</strong> smoother pipelines for exporting animations as code, assets, or embeddable components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom blocks:</strong> a clearer path for authoring reusable composite blocks directly from the UI.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not all of these exist yet in the UI, but the internal architecture (compiler, runtime, compositors) is shaped to make them
        possible.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

function BlocksOverviewPage() {
  return (
    <div className="help-center-page">
      <h2>Blocks</h2>
      <p>
        Blocks are the atoms of a patch. Each block has typed input and output ports and a small, focused responsibility. You wire
        them together to express scenes, timing, motion, and rendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internally, blocks fall into three structural forms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Macros</strong> – expand into a small graph of blocks when you drop them (great for starting points).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Composites</strong> – reusable subgraphs that appear as a single block in the editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Primitives</strong> – leaf nodes implemented directly in TypeScript and compiled into kernel artifacts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most day-to-day work involves combining primitives and composites. Macros help you quickly spin up illustrative patches
        that you can pick apart and customize.
      </p>
    </div>
  );

function BlocksMacrosPage() {
  return (
    <div className="help-center-page">
      <h2>Blocks: Macros</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Macro</strong> blocks are &quot;recipe starters&quot;. When you drop a macro into a lane, it expands into a prewired
        collection of blocks that implement a particular animation style.
      </p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✨ Line Drawing – reveals paths using animated strokes.</li>
        <li>✨ Particles – particles converge to form a shape.</li>
        <li>✨ Radial Burst, Cascade, Scatter, Implosion, Swarm, Nebula, Glitch Storm, Aurora, Liquid, Reveal Mask.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each macro sets up a full pipeline: Scene → Fields → Phase → Compose → Render → Output. You can inspect and edit the
        resulting blocks like any other patch.
      </p>
      <p>
        A recommended learning path is to drop a macro, explore the generated blocks and connections, and then gradually swap
        pieces for your own variants.

function BlocksCompositesPage() {

      <h2>Blocks: Composites</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Composite</strong> blocks wrap a small internal graph of primitives into a single, reusable unit with its own parameters
        and ports. They help keep complex patches readable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the current editor, some &quot;legacy-composite&quot; blocks still exist while the system moves toward explicit composite
        definitions. These act like composites in the UI but are backed by older code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, more behaviors will be expressed as composites, making it easier to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>share higher-level behaviors between patches,</li>
        <li>hide incidental complexity behind a friendly interface,</li>

    <div className="help-center-page">
      <h2>Blocks: Primitives</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Primitive</strong> blocks are the foundational operators. Each primitive directly compiles to a kernel artifact and has a
        clear, narrow responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>Some common primitive families:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sources</strong> – load Scenes or sample Targets (e.g., SVGPathSource, SamplePoints, TextSource).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fields</strong> – generate per-element values (RadialOrigin, RegionField, LinearStagger, SizeVariation, ColorField, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time</strong> – shape temporal structure (PhaseMachine, PhaseProgress, EaseRamp).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compose</strong> – combine ingredients into motion (PerElementTransport, PerElementProgress, LerpPoints).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Render</strong> – draw things (PerElementCircles, PathRenderer, Canvas, filters and effects).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Primitives are typed at the port level, which means the compiler can validate that you&apos;re wiring the right kinds of values
        together and provide clear error messages when something doesn&apos;t line up.

function PortsOverviewPage() {

      <h2>Ports</h2>
      <p>
        Ports are the connection points on blocks. Each port has a <strong>direction</strong> (input or output) and a
        <strong>type</strong> that describes what flows through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The editor shows port labels on blocks and can optionally display type hints. The compiler uses a stricter type system under
        the hood to keep patches sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        When wiring blocks, you&apos;re essentially deciding how values (Scenes, Fields, Signals, Programs) move from one computation
        to another.

function PortsFieldsPage() {

        <code>Field&lt;Duration&gt;</code>, or <code>Field&lt;number&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the kernel level, numeric fields share a common representation (<code>Field:number</code>), and point-like fields share
        another (<code>Field:vec2</code>). This lets primitives like PerElementProgress and PerElementTransport work with any field
        that produces the right shape of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fields are typically produced by Field blocks (RadialOrigin, RegionField, LinearStagger, etc.) and consumed by:

      <ul>
        <li>timing blocks (PerElementProgress, duration variations),</li>
        <li>motion blocks (origins, targets in LerpPoints or PerElementTransport),</li>

        <li>interpolators such as LerpPoints,</li>

        Signals and Fields often interact: a per-element Field gives each element a different parameter, while a Signal describes

        A Program is a function of time and runtime context that returns a RenderTree. The compiler expects the final output of

      <p>You can filter the Library in a few ways:</p>

        your animation pipeline.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scene lane:</strong> Where your source geometry lives (SVG paths, text, shapes).</li>
        <li><strong>Fields lane:</strong> Per-element values (positions, delays, durations, colors).</li>
        <li><strong>Phase lane:</strong> Time structure (entrance, hold, exit phases).</li>
        <li><strong>Spec lane:</strong> Animation specifications combining fields and timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Program lane:</strong> The compiled animation program.</li>
        <li><strong>Output lane:</strong> Rendering and output blocks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use lane descriptions and type hints to keep structure clear. The compiler validates that you&apos;re wiring compatible types together.
